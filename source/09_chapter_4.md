## Impact of Virtual Content Realism

The three components of virtual content realism are estimated ambient lighting, shadows and physically based rendering, which can provide a more realistic view for the users. The estimated ambient lighting can apply to an object according to the actual change of light. The shadows can apply to the object at its body by directional lighting and below it by the image of baked shadow. The physical based rendering can render different materials for the objects. It textures different materials, so the materials will be similar to what we see in real life. 

## Impact of Measurement

The measurement searching is able to allow the users to search for the furniture objects which are suitable for their measurements. It is able to allow the users to measure for more than one distance for each search, and the measurements can be stored temporarily in the Realm. The measuring path is dynamic, which can change size and direction according to the user's finger movement. It is more convenient than asking the user to point the start point and the endpoint, because the user needs to walk towards the endpoint and point it. But if we use the measuring path, moving the device has been already sufficient to do the measurement.
