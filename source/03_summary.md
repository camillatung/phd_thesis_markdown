# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

Augmented Reality (AR) is a new technology in recent years that many people discuss. It can extend to the real world's content and enrich our experience. It is just like a glimpse of "Mirror World", which is a term first popularized by David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale University. It means that we can create a virtual world, known as "Mirror World", which is a duplicate of the real world, and we can control it, interact with it and feel it. Although it is only an imagination, AR is the basis of this dream, and there will be a chance to make this dream come true. Therefore, I am interested in AR development.

This project aims to create a mobile AR application that allows people to play around their home. They can place a furniture object into the real world and interact with it. ARKit is a tool produced by Apple Inc. in 2017 and it can provide a high-quality AR experience, so I will use it to develop the application in this project.
